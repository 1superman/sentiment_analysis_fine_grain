## Introduction

Fine grain sentiment analysis from AI challenger, with data and runnable code and performances

Important Notice: this project is based on pengshuang/AI-Comp's project(baseline), most of code is reused here. Here we reused 

this baseline, the main purpose is to save time as this code is runnable and have a reasonable performance already. 

On line f1 score is 0.702 as reported in this baseline. we just want to try some new ideas, especially some new models,

new technique introduced recently such as pre-train of language model on large corpus and gain fine. this project is on

its early stage.

## Experiment on New Models

add something here.

## Usage

    class_*.py file for model
    model_*_char.py file for training
    validation_*_char.py genreate validation result  
    evaluate_char.py compute f1 score on validation set 
    predict_*_char.py generate online submit file
